Scene Editor
    * Next to sliders, put text boxes which hold the value that can be changed by the slider or by entering text

To Do List:
    [] Save scene
    [] Load scene
    [] Random scene
    [] Close and open editor

    *** Use VisUI Color Picker for selecting color ***
    [] Change background color
    [] Change moon color
    [] Change ring colors
        [] List of possible colors for the ring
    [] Change cloud colors
    [] Change star colors

    [] Planet customization ** (Would probably involve recreating the planet texture)
        [] Change planet layer colors
        [] Change height of planet layers
        [] ??? Add additional planet layers

Other ideas:
    [] Use VisUI TabbedPane to organize moons, rings, etc
    [] Add tooltips to parts of the UI
