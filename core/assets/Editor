Scene Editor

Idea:
    A scene in the scene editor will start with just a planet
    On the right side, there are buttons 'Add Moon', 'Add Ring', etc
    When those are clicked, a section is added to the scroll pane containing the below elements
    These elements can be modified, which will modify the corresponding objects in scene

    * Next to sliders, put text boxes which hold the value that can be changed by the slider or by entering text

Rings:
    [X] angularVelocity: slider 0 -> 100
    [X] zTilt: slider -90 -> 90
    [X] xTilt: slider -90 -> 90
    [] minimumRadius: slider 0 -> 500
    [] maximumRadius: slider 0 -> 500
    [] velocityDirection: checkbox
